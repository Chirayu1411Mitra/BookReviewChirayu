        <p><b>Review : </b>From the universe of the Until the End of the World series
            Book two of The City Series is here!
            (Note: The City Series can be read before or after the Until the End of the World series)
            
            Months into the apocalypse, the zombies show no signs of dying, but it's clear everyone in Sunset Park will die without enough food to outlast the undead. Add in the less-than-sociable new neighbors only blocks away, and the hunt for sustenance has come to feel more like a race than a ramble.
            
            Sylvie is happy in her new home with the people whove become like family, though she’s still working out how to let them into her heart. Eric wants in, and he wants to find his sister, but he can’t do both at the same time. If he can do the second one at all—getting into the city was hard enough, getting out may prove impossible.
            
            Despite setbacks—and a couple million zombies—it seems fortune is working in their favor. After all, food, security, and family are extraordinary when just being alive is a notable accomplishment. But fortune can turn on a dime, and all it takes is one misstep..</p>

        <p><b>Review : </b> In the early days of the Civil War, rumors of gold in the frozen Klondike brought hordes of newcomers to the Pacific Northwest. Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska's ice. Thus was Dr. Blue's Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.</p>

        <p><b>Author : </b>Brian Van Norman</p>
        <p><b>Review : </b> Earth, 2212: The novel, third in the Against The Machine trilogy, yet free standing on its own, tells of a dystopian society in the midst of catastrophic climate change. Billions have died. The minority of people remaining inhabit the MEGs, former cities transformed by technology into huge protective domes; outside is the MASS living by subsistence. All seems well for those in the CORPORATE. It is not. With worsening climate, the MASS increasingly restive and their AI Silicons becoming sentient, those at the top have concocted a final to leave Earth for Alpha Centauri, destroying the planet in their wake. Four protagonists, each from separate segments of this world, come together to attempt to prevent the plan. By the end they have managed to alter the human/machine interface, so changing human evolution.</p>

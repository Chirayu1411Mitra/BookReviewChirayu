        <p><b>Review : </b>From the universe of the Until the End of the World series
            Book two of The City Series is here!
            (Note: The City Series can be read before or after the Until the End of the World series)
            
            Months into the apocalypse, the zombies show no signs of dying, but it's clear everyone in Sunset Park will die without enough food to outlast the undead. Add in the less-than-sociable new neighbors only blocks away, and the hunt for sustenance has come to feel more like a race than a ramble.
            
            Sylvie is happy in her new home with the people whove become like family, though she’s still working out how to let them into her heart. Eric wants in, and he wants to find his sister, but he can’t do both at the same time. If he can do the second one at all—getting into the city was hard enough, getting out may prove impossible.
            
            Despite setbacks—and a couple million zombies—it seems fortune is working in their favor. After all, food, security, and family are extraordinary when just being alive is a notable accomplishment. But fortune can turn on a dime, and all it takes is one misstep..</p>

        <p><b>Author : </b>Brian Van Norman</p>
        <p><b>Review : </b> Earth, 2212: The novel, third in the Against The Machine trilogy, yet free standing on its own, tells of a dystopian society in the midst of catastrophic climate change. Billions have died. The minority of people remaining inhabit the MEGs, former cities transformed by technology into huge protective domes; outside is the MASS living by subsistence. All seems well for those in the CORPORATE. It is not. With worsening climate, the MASS increasingly restive and their AI Silicons becoming sentient, those at the top have concocted a final to leave Earth for Alpha Centauri, destroying the planet in their wake. Four protagonists, each from separate segments of this world, come together to attempt to prevent the plan. By the end they have managed to alter the human/machine interface, so changing human evolution.</p>

        <p><b>Review : </b>FROM FORMER GREEN BERET AND USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR JASON KASPER For David Rivers and his team, the mission was supposed to be simple—retrieve a defecting militia leader and deliver him to CIA interrogators. But nothing is simple in Yemen, where vast swaths of terrain are controlled by Houthi and Al Qaeda fighters. When they locate the asset, the team discovers why he has been deemed critical to their intelligence effort. The defector has direct knowledge of the team's top Erik Weisz, the shadowy figurehead behind the most catastrophic terrorist attacks since 9/11. And as it turns out, Weisz is currently in Yemen, traveling through Houthi territory with heavy security. As David's crew prepares for a follow-on operation to remove Weisz once and for all, they discover a web of contradictions. A sudden order to stand down leaves the unit questioning the motives of their CIA handler. With suspicious leadership and a deadly conspiracy looming, the team boards a military aircraft to infiltrate the most dangerous corners of a war-torn desert. David is convinced it will be their bloodiest mission yet—and within hours of being inserted deep into the badlands of Yemen, he and his team realize they are pawns in an exceedingly deadly game of chess.</p>

                <p><b>Review : </b>Captain Dominic Holland leads a crew of skilled covert operatives and talented scientific personnel. He's taken them to all corners of the earth to protect the United States from biological and chemical warfare. When his CIA handler, Meredith Webb, gives him a mission to investigate a disturbing lead on a laboratory based out of an abandoned oil rig, they discover the most terrifying threat to mankind they've ever faced—a genetically engineered biological weapon called the Oni Agent.

                    Back in the United States, Meredith discovers a frightening connection between the CIA and the Oni Agent. But her investigations are short-lived when the Agent spreads and brings mankind to its knees. Cities burn as it turns humans into warped creatures hell-bent on destruction.
                    
                    Dominic and Meredith vow to do everything they can to combat the Agent and find a cure. But will their efforts be enough to turn the tide—or is humanity's fate already sealed?</p>
